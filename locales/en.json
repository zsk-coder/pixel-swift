      "q1": "How do I convert PNG to JPG online?",
      "a1": "Simply upload your PNG file, select JPG as the output format, then click Process. Your converted file will be ready to download instantly — no server upload required.",
      "q2": "What is the difference between WebP and JPG?",
      "a2": "WebP is a newer image format that produces much smaller files than JPG while looking just as good. It also supports transparent backgrounds like PNG. Most modern browsers and apps support it — it's the recommended format for websites today.",
      "q3": "Does converting image formats affect quality?",
      "a3": "It depends on the formats. Converting from JPG to PNG won't lose quality. But converting between JPG and WebP may cause a very slight quality reduction — in most cases you won't notice the difference. PixelSwift uses the best possible settings to keep your images looking great.",
      "q4": "What is the best image format for websites?",
      "a4": "For websites, WebP is the best choice — smaller file sizes, great quality, and supports transparent backgrounds. If you need to support very old browsers, use JPG. If you need a perfectly sharp image with transparency, use PNG.",
      "q5": "Can I convert multiple images at once?",
      "a5": "Yes! PixelSwift supports batch conversion of up to 20 images at once. Simply drag and drop all your files, select the output format, and they'll be processed simultaneously.",
      "q6": "How do I convert images while keeping transparency?",
      "a6": "To keep transparency, convert to PNG or WebP format — both support transparent backgrounds. JPG does not support transparency and will replace transparent areas with a white background."

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "How to compress images without losing quality?",
      "a1": "Set the quality slider to 80-90%. At this level, the image looks virtually the same but the file size drops significantly. Use the side-by-side comparison view to check the result before downloading.",
      "q2": "What is the difference between compressing PNG and JPG?",
      "a2": "JPG compression makes the file smaller by reducing image detail — the lower the quality setting, the smaller the file. PNG compression works differently — it simplifies colors to shrink the file while keeping the image looking nearly identical. PixelSwift handles both automatically.",
      "q3": "How much can I reduce an image file size?",
      "a3": "Typically, JPG images can be reduced by 40-70%, and PNG images by 20-50%. The exact result depends on the image itself — photos with many colors compress less than simple graphics. Want even smaller files? Try converting to WebP format with our Converter tool.",
      "q4": "What is the ideal image size for a website?",
      "a4": "For websites, each image should ideally be under 200KB. Large banner images can be 300-500KB. Set the quality slider to 75-85% for the best balance between image quality and loading speed. Smaller images = faster website = better Google ranking.",
      "q5": "Can I compress images for email attachments?",
      "a5": "Yes! Most email providers limit attachments to 25MB. Use PixelSwift to compress your images to a smaller size — set quality to 70-80% to reduce photos significantly while keeping them looking great in emails.",
      "q6": "Is PixelSwift better than TinyPNG for compression?",
      "a6": "Both produce excellent results. The key difference: TinyPNG uploads your files to their server for processing, while PixelSwift processes everything locally in your browser. If privacy matters to you, PixelSwift is the better choice since your images never leave your device."

      "q1": "How do I resize an image to a specific size?",
      "a1": "Upload your image, enter the exact width and height in pixels, or use percentage mode to scale proportionally. You can also use quick presets for common sizes like 1:1, 4:3, or 16:9. Click Resize & Download to get your resized image.",
      "q2": "Does resizing an image reduce quality?",
      "a2": "Making an image smaller may reduce quality slightly, but PixelSwift uses smart processing to keep the result as sharp as possible. Making an image larger can cause some blurriness — it's always best to start with a high-resolution original.",
      "q3": "What is the difference between scaling and cropping?",
      "a3": "Scaling changes the overall dimensions of your entire image — making it larger or smaller while keeping all content visible. Cropping cuts away parts of the image to focus on a specific area. PixelSwift's resizer uses scaling to preserve your complete image.",
      "q4": "What are the best image sizes for social media?",
      "a4": "Common sizes: Instagram post 1080×1080px, Instagram story 1080×1920px, Facebook cover 820×312px, Twitter/X header 1500×500px, LinkedIn banner 1584×396px. Use PixelSwift's quick presets to resize to these dimensions easily.",
      "q5": "Can I resize images without stretching or distortion?",
      "a5": "Yes. Enable 'Lock Aspect Ratio' (on by default) — when you change the width, the height adjusts automatically to maintain the original proportions. This prevents any stretching or squishing.",
      "q6": "What image resolution (DPI) should I use for printing?",
      "a6": "For printing photos, your image needs to be large enough — about 300 pixels per inch of print. For example, to print a standard 4×6 inch photo, you need at least a 1200×1800 pixel image. For screens and websites, smaller sizes work fine."
