      "q2": "What is the difference between WebP and JPG?",
      "a2": "WebP is a modern format developed by Google that offers 25-35% smaller file sizes than JPG at comparable quality. It supports transparency (like PNG) and is ideal for web use. However, JPG has broader compatibility with older software.",
      "q3": "Does converting image formats affect quality?",

      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "How to compress images without losing quality?",
      "a1": "Use PixelSwift's quality slider set to 80-90% for near-lossless compression. At this level, the visual difference is imperceptible while file sizes can be reduced by 40-60%. You can use the side-by-side comparison to verify quality before downloading.",
      "q2": "What is the difference between compressing PNG and JPG?",
      "a2": "JPG compression removes visual data (lossy) — lower quality means smaller files. PNG compression intelligently reduces the number of colors (similar to TinyPNG) — significantly shrinking file size while keeping the visual result nearly identical. PixelSwift handles both automatically based on your input format.",
      "q3": "How much can I reduce an image file size?",
      "a3": "Typical results: JPG images can be reduced by 40-70%, PNG images by 20-50%. Results vary based on image content, color complexity, and your quality settings. For even greater size savings, try converting to WebP format using our Converter tool."

      "q2": "Does resizing an image reduce quality?",
      "a2": "Reducing image dimensions slightly lowers quality since pixels are removed. However, PixelSwift uses high-quality bicubic interpolation to minimize quality loss. Enlarging images may cause blurriness as new pixels must be created.",
      "q3": "What is the difference between scaling and cropping?",
      "a3": "Scaling changes the overall dimensions of your entire image — making it larger or smaller while keeping all content visible. Cropping cuts away parts of the image to focus on a specific area. PixelSwift's resizer uses scaling to preserve your complete image."
